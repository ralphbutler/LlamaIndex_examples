# LlamaIndex_examples
LangChain examples for AuroraGPT

These are examples (snippets of code with some text), not full tutorials.
Some of the examples are rough and not well commented.

To prepare you should probably create a virtual env via either conda
or python's venv module.  Then make sure you activate the venv.  And,
then do this:
    pip install -r requirements_mm.txt   # for the MultiModal examples
